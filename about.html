                  <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is rayan khan. I am the owner, Heavenly  Desert, office manger and dishwasher (Yup I do it all!) of the The Cake Shop!

                    Born and raised near Washington DC, I got my start working at a bakery when I was 16. I immediately fell in love with everything baking. I applied, and got accepted to The Culinary Institute of America were I received my AOS and BPS in baking and pastry. After Graduating I spent a short stint in restaurants before finding my true passion, custom cakes. Since then I’ve had the honor to work at, and learn from, some of the best cake shops in the country. Following an internship at Mark Joseph Cakes in NYC, I spent 4 years decorating cakes at Betty bakery and Cheryl Kleinman cakes in Brooklyn, New York. I then spent 3 years at BAKED custom cakes in Seattle. I've worked and collaborated on several cakes that have been featured in different wedding magazines. I also have competed on several Food Network shows.Enlivened by incredible crisp fixings, our little neighborhood pastry shop on a corner in downtown Chicago started making craftsman bread and naturally prepared desserts. Also, upon a little achievement, neighbors started to approach us for sandwiches made with that awesome bread, trailed by handcrafted soups and servings of mixed greens, and even made-to-arrange scramblers.

                    Our visitors’ solicitations kept on moving us as our bread kitchen’s menu and business developed.
                    
                    Today, we keep on satisfying the requirements and wants of our neighbors with a menu of fixing enlivened, arranged to arrange nourishment. When you visit our bistro, you’ll see genuine kitchens instead of sequential construction systems. You’ll hear the slashing of more than 40 sorts of crisp herbs, products of the soil, and the sizzle of our genuine panini barbecue.
                    
                    You’ll see the stove’s open fire and feel the glow from our broilers working throughout the day. They’re the customs we set up years prior that we still enthusiastically pursue today.We will in general overlook that satisfaction doesn’t originate from something we don’t have, yet rather of perceiving and acknowledging what we do… Satisfaction is fellowship… Joy is festivity. It’s tied in with acquiring bliss and praising life.Spreading bliss and commending each snapshot of life is the mantra at ‘heavenly desert’. ‘heavenly desert’ started their endeavor with Handmade Chocolates and gradually moved into Cakes, Pastries, and unified items.

                    Everything started with taking up little gathering requests. With the progression of time, we moved to counters in markets and now have 50 outlets in the city of LA. ‘heavenly desert’ develops with each passing day and connecting with individuals and adding to mind-blowing festivals</p>
